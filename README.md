# GroceryStore
Problem Statement:
 There are many issues that are faced by our elders and us, when we go to buy home essentials or groceries. Sometimes we forgot some item and their quantity too.
 So, as we know technology plays an important role in our life especially mobile phones. So, Mobile Application can be effectively used for this problem
 as they are widely used and easy to access.

Proposed Solution:
 This project “Grocery Store” helps you to store the item as many as you want and delete them when you are done. The app includes item name its price, its quantity and
 its total amount too based on quantity and price. And it’s also a very handy and easy to use app, so that anyone can use it.

Functionality and Concepts used:
 1. LiveData: I have used LiveData to observe and update any changes in the grocery items, their price their quantity and to delete any item using room.

 2. Room Database: I am storing the list and its data in a room database. So that it will be used for future purpose.  

 3. Navigation Library: I have used navigation for connecting the fragments which is the Splash fragment and main activity fragment.
 I have used navigation graph for this.

 4. Recyclerview: To present the list of all items I have used recyclerview. Also I have used cardview for entering the details of product 
 which is one of the application of Recyclerview.

Future Scope:
 If this app is successful then not only for elders and us, even the seller can use this app to handle his or her business. Also, I wanted to add a 
 sharing option in this app so that the user can send his or her list to anyone, but I couldn’t as its benefit the user to share their list when they need. 
 So, this is a very effective app and I want a greater number of people to use this app in future.
